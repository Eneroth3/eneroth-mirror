# Eneroth Mirror Tool

Originally a custom extension of mine that turned into a mockup of a proposed
design for native Flip Along.

Behaviors:

* Click plane "handle" to flip around axis
* Click any face to flip around it
* Click on bounds (but not on selected geometry) to flip around it
* Press and drag to flip along any custom plane
* Live preview on hover
