# Eneroth Mirror Tool

Originally a custom extension of mine that turned into a mockup of a proposed
design for native Flip Along.

Behaviors:

* Click "standard plane" to flip along axis at center
* Click any face to flip around it
* Click on bounds (but not on selected geometry) to flip around its boundary
* Press and drag to flip along any custom plane
* Live preview on hover

## Installation

Place the content of the `src/` folder in your SketchUp plugin's folder,
e.g. `%appdata%\SketchUp\SketchUp 2022\SketchUp\Plugins`.
